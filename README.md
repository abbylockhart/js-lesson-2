# CLG ASSIGNMENT 1
Lesson 2 - Javascript

INSTRUCTIONS
In your scripts.js, declare and initialise variables to hold your website data (these could be portfolio projects, movie data, city weather, anything and everything you like)

Store all different types of primitive values in your variables - numbers, strings, booleans, even null

Output the variables to your console (you could use console.log in your scripts.js or directly in the console) to prepare for how you might include the data on the frontend of your website in the future.

E.g. Concatenate strings with variables to create content for your web page.

Once youâ€™ve set up all your variables with data, use some of the console object methods you learnt about in this lesson to clear your console or add a console warning.

Optional bonus step: Explore MDN docs to apply methods to variables.
e.g. Try converting some text to a different case using a method you can find on the MDN docs
